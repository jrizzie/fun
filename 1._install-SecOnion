installing security onion--
During installation you're supposed to choose 2 NICs (both bridged)
If you choose DHCP; it will give you the same IP address as your host VM.  So don't do that.  Choose Static, and find an IP address on your home network that isn't in use.
Once you assign it with Security Onion, reserve that IP to your SO VM in your home network/router.
